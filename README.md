# Arithmetic Quiz Generator

This is a simple C++ console-based application that generates random arithmetic equations for the user to solve. The program evaluates the user's answers and provides immediate feedback, tracking the number of correct responses.

## Introduction

The Arithmetic Quiz Generator is a small program that helps users practice basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It generates random equations and prompts the user to solve them, then provides feedback on whether the answers are correct or incorrect.

## Features

- **Random Equation Generation**: Generates random arithmetic equations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback on whether the user's answer is correct or incorrect.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks the number of correct answers out of the total number of attempts.
  
## File Structure
- `main.cpp`: The main program file containing the implementation of the arithmetic quiz.

## Dependencies
This project requires a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. No additional libraries are needed beyond the C++ Standard Library.
